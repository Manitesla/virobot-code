                                                       Title- Virobot:The Artificial Nurse
                                                       
Project Description:This project is a robot that is designed to act as a medical assistant robot which can be controlled by nurses or doctors from a distance using their smart phone or it can just use autonomous navigation to reach the patients and give them required medicines, monitor patients health and stream all the patient information wirelessly through the internet to your palm(mobile). And, it has built-in UV sterilizer lights, which sterilizes the hospital wherever it travels. Not only it can carry lightweight packages and sterilize the hospital, It can be used as a telecommunication robot ad establish communication between doctor and patient since it is a built-in FPV camera and a Bluetooth speaker. The best thing is all these features are connected to the internet hence the doctor can get data from the robot from anywhere around the world.

Code Description :The project consists of two sets of code , one for the arduino and another for the Nodemcu , Bothe the microcontrollers talk to each other via serial communication
